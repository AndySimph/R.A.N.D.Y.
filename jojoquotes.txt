"Shut up! Get outta my face, you bitch!"
"Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you come right to me? Even though your grandfather, Joseph, told you the secret of The World, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?"
"I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer."
"Yare Yare Daze"
"Look, no one ever said Jotaro Kujo was a nice guy. I beat the crap out of people, more than I have to. Some are even still in the hospital. I've had idiot teachers who like to talk big, so I taught them a lesson, and they never came back to class. If I go to a restaurant and the food's bad, I make it a policy to stiff 'em with the bill. But, even a bastard like me... can spot true evil when he sees it! True evil are those who use the weak for their own gain, and crush them underfoot when they're through! Especially an innocent woman! And that is exactly what you've done, isn't it!? And your Stand gets to hide from the victim, the law, and the consequences! That's why... I will judge you myself!"
"Your Stand may be invincible, but you sure as hell aren't! If I destroy you, then your Stand dies too. Do you understand? Listen, I've had it up to here with that cocky-ass mouth of yours, alright? I just happen to be the type of guy who takes these things to heart!"
"Just shut up already. I have nothing more to say to you. You're way too pathetic... I'm done wasting my breath."
"Good grief. You truly are the lowest scum in history. You can't pay back what you owe... with money!"
"Here's your receipt."
"Good grief. Don't underestimate me because I'm a kid."
"Wait, I still have my rights to raise." (...) "I raise you my mother's soul!" (...) "I came to Egypt to save my mother, so if I wager her soul, she won't mind. But, D'Arby, you'll have to match my mother's soul. For that... I'll have you tell me the secret of Dio's Stand!" (...) "So, do you call or fold!? Let's hear you say it out loud, D'Arby!!"
You want to know whether I'll forgive you, why don't you just do what you do best and read my mind?" (NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!) "Answer this. Will I hit you with my right fist, or decide to deck you with my left? I'd love to know." (Well, since you're asking, you'll use... your right one? ) (NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!) (Then... your left?) (NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!) (You're... not going to use both, are you!?'') (YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!!)
"If this were the Wild West, the hero would say "It's High Noon." Now get off the ground and draw your piece, DIO. You're getting one shot."
"There's a reason you lost, DIO. One simple reason... You pissed me off."
"OH MY GOD!"
"HOLY SHIT!"
"SON OF A BITCH!"
"Jotaro! How dare you talk to your mother that way! And Holly, stop smiling at him, you'll only encourage it!"
"Well, I guess now you can see the difference in our fighting experience. Once your opponent started boasting their victory, they've already lost! This is how Joseph Joestar does things! I guess I just get better with age. And! A Stand can only be defeated by a Stand! Your next line is, 'Stop, anything but that!'"
"ARE YOU GOING TO DO THE "ORA ORA" THING?!"
"I'm not sure myself of why I want to go... but you awakened me. That's all."
"Rerorerorerorerorero."
"EMERALD SPLASH!"
"Now, it's time for you punishment, baby."
"Guys like him get in the way, that’s why I said I’d do this myself! It really annoys me... having people up and die on me... it just annoys me so much!"
"You're really good at crying, J. Geil. Well, you're about to fall down to Hell, sobbing the whole way down. But there's one thing I can't rely on the guardians of Hell to do for me. And that's... To turn you into a pincushion!"
"Aww, man. And I have one hand signal I'm ready to show..." (shows the hand signal) (Kakyoin: "Your panties are showing.") "YEAH!!"
"Good grief. I can' let a kid who likes dogs... get killed!"
ZA WARUDO! TOKI YO TOMARE!
"Seven seconds have passed...HERE'S A ROAD ROLLER!!!" (...) "Too late! You can't escape!! MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA— Eight seconds have passed! WRRRRRRYYYYYY!!!! I'LL CRUSH YOU FLAT!!!"
''"WHAAAAAAAT!? I-IMPOSSIBLE! I AM DIO.... I AM DIOOOOOO!!!!"
"'He's... mocking me! But Jotaro, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, or living your life without regrets. That reasoning is as compelling as rat shit in the bathroom and it will be your demise! I, Dio, have no such thoughts. Within my mind but one simple thought. Just one! To be victorious and rule! That is all. That is all I need to feel satisfaction! How I do it doesn't matter!"
"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT MY HAIR?! (...) I will not forgive anyone who insults my hair, no matter who he is! Did you just say my hair looks like Sazae-san's!?"
"Great!"
"The way I see it, if I make you well again, and THEN kick your ass, I won't be "bullying the weak" then, now will I?"
"I feel utterly refreshed! Like I put on a new pair of underwear on New Years day!"
"I'm gonna 'fix' that spaghetti and reduce it to its original ingredients!"
"No matter how you look at it, I look like a normal high school student, so why would you ask me to help?"
"Why do I have to regretfully run away in fear of a murderer like "Please, god, help me"!? Shouldn't it be the other way around!? Why do I think that I'd rather be looking for a public restroom while I have diarrhoea if I could only get out of this situation safely!? Isn't something wrong!? The one who should be running away in fear... is you, murderer!"
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. You're going to kill me. Good for you. But..... I found out your name. That makes you pretty careless. You might get away for now, but will you be able to live with the fact that some fucking brat got your name so easily? Let me say that again... some fucking brat...... got your name! You're totally exposed! I'll be waiting for you in Hell!"
"Nice watch. I'm going to break it so you can never tell time again. Your face, that is."
"Good freaking grief, now that I can see it up close, your watch looks like crap. But you won't have to worry about that. After all, I'm about to make it look even worse. Your face, that is."
"Koichi, you truly are a reliable guy."
"I just wanted to look cool in front of my little boy."
"If... If I call him, w-will you... spare my life?" (...) "But I refuse. One of the things I, Rohan Kishibe, like the most is to find someone who thinks they're some hot shit, and say 'No' right to their faces."
"DO YOU THINK THAT I, ROHAN KISHIBE, DRAW MANGA FOR MONEY AND FAME!? I draw comics because I want to be read! That's the one and only reason. I couldn't care less about anything else!"
"You may think that hairstyle is cool, but it doesn't suit you at all! It's lame!"
"PHEWWW~ When I was a kid... you know Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, right...? I saw it in an art book. When I saw Mona Lisa's hands folded by her knee... how do I say this...? It's a bit crude, but... I got... a BONER."
"I want to show that woman the true Yoshikage Kira. I want her to hear how I feel deep inside. That I want to take your slender neck into these hands and strangle you to death."
"DON'T EVER ANSWER A QUESTION WITH A QUESTION! YOU DID LEARN PROPER ETIQUETTE WHILE YOU WERE IN SCHOOL, NOW DIDN'T YOU?! I'M ASKING YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOUR NAME IS!"
